# Recon Scripts

## scan.sh

This script requires a file named ip_addresses in the same folder. It should be a text file with one ip address per line. The script will create a folder with the name of the ip address, run nmap on the ip with results going to the new folder then it will run searchsploit --nmap with the generated xml file and output the results into the potential.txt file.
